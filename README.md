The Airbnb business model functions as a two-sided platform connecting travelers with hosts worldwide, revolutionizing the hospitality industry by facilitating trust between property owners and short-term renters. Originating in 2008 from the simple idea of renting out air mattresses to cover rent expenses, Airbnb has evolved into a global marketplace, operating solely through digital platforms- mobile apps and websites.

Unlike traditional hospitality services, Airbnb does not own any physical properties; instead, it serves as a facilitator, matching individuals offering accommodations with those seeking them. Similar to Uber, which arranges over a million rides daily without owning vehicles, Airbnb processes nearly 80,000 reservations per day despite lacking its own lodging facilities.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
