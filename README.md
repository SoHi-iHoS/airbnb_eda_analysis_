The Airbnb business model functions as a two-sided platform connecting travelers with hosts worldwide, revolutionizing the hospitality industry by facilitating trust between property owners and short-term renters. Originating in 2008 from the simple idea of renting out air mattresses to cover rent expenses, Airbnb has evolved into a global marketplace, operating solely through digital platforms- mobile apps and websites.

Unlike traditional hospitality services, Airbnb does not own any physical properties; instead, it serves as a facilitator, matching individuals offering accommodations with those seeking them. Similar to Uber, which arranges over a million rides daily without owning vehicles, Airbnb processes nearly 80,000 reservations per day despite lacking its own lodging facilities.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

### **This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values.**

## **Understanding Airbnb Business model**
The revenue of Airbnb comes from three main sources:

* **Commission from Hosts:** This fee varies from 3 to 5% of the amount charged for the rent. The host can list their properties for free and, with each booking, Airbnb deducts its commission. For hosts offering experiences (events and activities), the commission is 20%.

* **Fees from Guests:** Airbnb charges 0% to 20% of the booking amount as transaction fees. This charge is also made with each reservation and varies according to the courses involved.

* **Host-only fee:**
  * Hosts who list traditional hospitality listings, such as hotels and serviced apartments, or software-connected hosts—via software integrations with Airbnb—pay host-only fees. However, unless a major part of their listings are in the US, Uruguay, Canada, etc., software-connected hosts don’t have to pay a host-only fee.

  * Host-only fees are usually between 14% and 16%, but for hosts with Airbnb Plus listings or who have a very strict cancellation policy, the payment is likely to be higher. To streamline payment, the fee is taken out of the host’s payout before disbursement.

## **Our goal/objective:**

The primary aim of this analysis is to uncover and define the key performance indicators (KPIs) that significantly impact the listing of properties on the Airbnb platform. Through thorough exploration and visualization of the Airbnb dataset focused on New York City (NYC), we seek to identify the fundamental metrics influencing property listings and their pricing.

Our business objective is to extract actionable insights from the dataset, specifically pinpointing KPIs and their associated factors without posing specific inquiries. Utilizing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we delve into various aspects of the dataset, including property distribution based on location, price ranges, room types, listing characteristics, and other pertinent variables.

By conducting this analysis from diverse perspectives, we aim to derive valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making, enhance understanding of market dynamics, and optimize performance within the Airbnb ecosystem.
